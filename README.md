As a software developer for small businesses, a lot of the work I produce for my clients is confidential

This is a collection of a few economics-related projects. While not all files may be easy to view directly on GitHub, downloading them will allow you to run the application yourself. To the best of my knowledge, all files are safe to download.

The first set of files demonstrates different methods for solving a competitive equilibrium using the Shooting Star Algorithm and the Genetic Algorithm.

This file includes a shortest path algorithm, an example of dynamic programming commonly used in economics for sequential decision-making, and understanding the network effects that maybe missing from traditional equilibrium models. The second file is a text file which has a sample network configuration for testing.

Having taken multivariable calculous in my second year, I decided to use computational tools to visualise some of the techniques.

If you are interested in my work for businesses, my first client from 2019 has allowed me to publish the first edition of the management software I created for them. This software is no longer in use as of 2025.
